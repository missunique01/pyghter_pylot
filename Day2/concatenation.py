# If we add two string it is called as Concatenation

print(10+1)
print(10.5+2.5)
print(10 + 4.6)

# Performing COncatenation
print("Welcome" + " To My Github")

# Using True & False
# Python Considers True's Default value as 1 and False's Default value as 0

print(True + 5)  # 6
print(False+5) # 5

print(True + True) # 2
print(False+False)  # 0

# Adding Number & String
# print(10 + "Welcome")
# print(10.5 + "Welcome)
